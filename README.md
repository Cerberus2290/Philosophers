* Your project must be written in C.
* Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. <br>If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.
* Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. <br>If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
* All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.
* If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output <br>with the flags **-Wall**, **-Wextra** and **-Werror**, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
* Your **Makefile** must at least contain the rules **$(NAME)**, **all**, **clean**, **fclean** and **re**.
* To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, <br>librairies or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. <br>Bonuses must be in a different file **_bonus.{c/h}** if the subject does not specify anything else. <br>Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.
* If your project allows you to use your **libft**, you must copy its sources and its associated **Makefile** in a **libft** folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s **Makefile** must compile the library by using its **Makefile**, then compile the project.
* We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work **won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded**. <br>It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. <br>Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
* Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. <br>If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. <br>If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
